Obsolete MamaMod Changelog Below (These changes do not reflect the current state of the project)

Version 0.1.2
	Updated to support HardTimes 0.1.4-release2 (Apr 8th steam update)
		This Obsoleted some of the Shops changes
	Items inside containers are now properly converted into their useable item versions on game load and are useable inside containers
	Medical items added to useable item types
	Known Issue: Items inside furniture revert to non-useable type after loading a savegame.
		This is because the player inventory is the only one hooked up right now. Might be possible to sneak into the furniture array after game start
		The above fix still wouldn't help lose containers on the ground

Version 0.1.1
	Features that were previously available in-line assembly-csharp are being ported (where possible) to the new patches/overrides methods
		The Changelist at the top of the log will have what features are actually working.
		Previous version changes will be preserved in the logs but will not appear in game.
	Certain items can be used directly in the inventory by clicking on their icon instead of use button
		Currently Food, Drugs, Cleaning Items, Containers, and Wallets are supported
			Known issue: Items in containers inside the player inventory don't work right
			Plan to add Medicine soon

Version 0.1.0
	Complete incompatibility with previous versions due to core rewrite of how MamaMod works.
		No longer adds code directly to the original classes or methods unless absolutely required
		Injects extended classes onto objects that use them. Should be possible to disable them completely at some point without deleting MamaMod
		External configs will be easier to support for various options.
	Vending Machines can no longer be robbed. (No longer possible with new system)

Version 0.0.10
    MamaMod will enable debugging if the Mod MamaMod_Debug_MODPKG is loaded
    Removed all savegame name methods of debugging.

Version 0.0.9
    MamaMod will check if the MamaMod_MODKPG has been loaded and adjust her functions as needed to stay compatible
    Doors that can never be opened or shops that can never be robbed now clarify this is the case to avoid confusion (WIP commune doors)
    Shops of "buyier" type can no longer be robbed. (They always have an empty inventory anyway)
    Changed target of items dropped by robbing to be player instead of the shop object.

Version 0.0.8
    Vending Machines can now be robbed. Add the extra "vending_machine_robbery" to any shop to treat it like a vending machine
    Fixed a bug with robbing multiple stores (or the same store multiple times) simultaneously
        This issue exists in vanilla but isn't a problem since robberies drop the entire store's inventory
    Added IsRobbableVendingMachine() to MamaMod and updated ShopArchetipusManager to use it
    Vending machines in vanilla have been given the "vending_machine_robbery" extra in the new "MamaMod_MODPKG"

Version 0.0.7
    Added a new infopanel object to MamaMod to allow messages without using the playerUI

        InfoPanelMessage()

Version 0.0.5
    Values adjusted for DropRobberyItems to favor fewer items dropped after a robbery

Version 0.0.4
    Robbing a shop uses a new method to determine what items the player recieves (ShopInventory.DropRobberyItems)

    Removed scandal limit on shopping

    Debug mode is enabled/disabled via the save menu
    Player cannot shop at stores with more than 50 scandal

Version 0.0.1
    Lowered Pickpocket reward
    Getting caught stealing from a shop forces the shop window closed
